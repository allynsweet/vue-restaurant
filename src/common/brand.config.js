  'Marlon and Andres Soriano, two brothers that immigrated from El Salvador, are the founders of Que Chivo. A slang word used in Central America meaning “So cool”, Que Chivo is bringing that exact atmosphere to its new home at Parkville Market. Located in Connecticut’s first food hall, you will find traditional Salvadoran pupusas and tamales, as well as a full Salvadoran breakfast. Using fresh and authentic ingredients, the culture and heart of El Salvador is brought to life at Que Chivo. Stay cool. ';
